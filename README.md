# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BANK_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed a Bank Data Analysis project in collaboration with UNP using real-world banking data. The project involved cleaning, analyzing and visualizing customer and financial data using Microsoft Power BI. I created an interactive dashboard to show key insights such as customer distribution, account balances, and loan trends. This project helped me develop skills in data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard creation using Power BI.
