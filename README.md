# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BANK_DATA_ANALYSIS


I completed a Bank Data Analysis project in collaboration with UNP. In this Bank Data Analysis project, I imported raw banking data into Power BI and performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query to handle missing values, correct data types, and remove inconsistencies. I designed a proper data model by creating relationships between different tables to ensure accurate analysis. I created calculated columns and DAX measures to compute important KPIs such as total customers, total balance, total deposits, loan amounts, and transaction summaries. I built an interactive dashboard that includes KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and tables to visually represent customer distribution, branch performance, account types, and transaction trends. I also added slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data dynamically. Through this project, I applied data modeling, DAX functions, and visualization techniques to convert raw banking data into meaningful insights that help in monitoring performance and supporting decision-making.
